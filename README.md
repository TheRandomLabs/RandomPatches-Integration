# RandomPatches Integration

An addon to [RandomPatches](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randompatches) that
tweaks other mods. This is only used for experimental features or for other instances where
I can't directly get the tweaks implemented. The feature list can be found
[here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randompatches-integration).
